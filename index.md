# About Me:

I am a research assistant in the Machine Learning Group at TU Kaiserslautern led by Prof. Dr. Marius Kloft and Jun.-Prof. Dr. Sophie Fellenz. I am studying Master's in Computer Science at TU Kaiserslautern. I finished my Bachelor’s degree In Computer science and engineering from The German university in Cairo(GUC), Egypt. I have also worked in the GUC as a teaching assistant after graduating.

# Research interests:
I am interested in the Natural Language Processing and Generation area which is a subfield of Machine Learning. I love working with code-switching language data, sentiment analysis, and style transfer. I am also interested in the area of autonomous vehicles.
